SMART INDOOR AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM  - To maintain safe air quality and prevent air borne virus outbreak

This system can be used as a device in schools, homes, shopping malls or any other indoor places to sense quantity of CO2 in the air. In this IoT system, the quantity of carbon dioxide in the indoor air is observed regularly and when the concentration goes beyond the safer level, i.e., 1000 ppm, the user will be notified through SMS and email alerts, and a fan is switched on/off automatically to increase ventilation. This fan can be an exhaust fan or a fan placed as close as possible to a window to push outdoor air into indoors or indoor air out. Users are given instructions in alerts which help in increasing ventilation.

Proposed system has fan controlled by micro-controller. Fan is powered ON when CO2 level is above 1000 ppm and powered OFF when CO2 level goes below 800 ppm.
